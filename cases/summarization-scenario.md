Learn why this is important Hi Tom, Thank you for reaching out. Please note PTN is reserved for non-US and accredited investors. That appears to be the case, but just want to be clear. As for SpaceX, the price is $76/share plus 5% one-time up front management fee for an all-in price of $79.80. This is a slight discount to the tender offer which took place at $80/share and ~$150B valuation and a discount to where we see shares trading/available elsewhere. (Pitchbook attached) PTN's minimum investment is $10,000 and we have ~$2M available currently. We are responding to multiple investors who reached out over the weekend and early this morning. Shares are available on a first come first serve basis. Please let us know if you have any questions. I'd be happy to share additional details and provide a link to the electronic onboarding process if there is interest.

Our first investment in SpaceX was nearly 7 years ago. While the company has stayed private for over 20 years, they continue to grow and innovate at an incredible pace. Here is quick but entertaining 4.5 minute video showing "Every SpaceX Launch Attempt From Cape Canaveral 2010-2023". ﻿ As of this week, SpaceX has "already launched 74 orbital missions, more than any private outfit ever has in a single year. (The previous record was 61, set by SpaceX in 2022." - Space.com SpaceX is aiming to attempt 100 flights by the end of the year. With a goal of increasing to 12 flights/month or 144 flights in 2024! For a bit of a deeper dive and history lesson, feel free to check out "How SpaceX Reinvented the Rocket" presented by The Space Race. Currently, we have access to a small block of shares at what appears to be the best price in the market. We’re excited to have the opportunity to invest again and share this opportunity with our members. Please reach out if you are interested in learning more. ﻿Best, PTN Team PTN 31 Victoria Street Hamilton, Bermuda HM10 Homepage: www.PTNPortal.com Legal and Fund Admin: www.WQ.bm This confidential communication does not represent an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities.

email_send({"to":"willhackett@me.com","subject":"Re: Fwd: Reminder: SpaceX Available","body":"Hi Will,<br><br>The price of $79.80 per share for SpaceX, after accounting for the management fee, is slightly less than the recent tender offer of $80 per share. It is also below the valuation indicated by PitchBook for trades happening elsewhere in the market. These factors suggest that the price is competitive. However, financial decisions should be made considering the full context of the investment, including the associated risks and the long-term prospects of the company. Please review the investment information carefully or consult with a financial advisor before proceeding.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jamie"})
